# Convertions Helper
A blazing fast utility for converting data 

## Why should you switch to Convertions Helper?
You should switch to Convertions Helper because it is simple and fast!  Instead of using ```console.log(num + num)``` you can simply use a function like ```celsiusToFahrenheit(num)``` and it will automatically convert this into your selected measure.  Also it is a little bit faster tha the normal console.log() 

Proofs:

![testconsolelog](/images/testconsolelog.png) Using ```console.log()```

**All these test were made on the same file, on the same machine, and runned at the same time**


## Requirements
For using Convertions Helper you will need the following requirements:
- NodeJS (Minimum v22)
- An IDE, or a program that lets you create and modify javascript files
- A terminal and the "jest" package if you want to have also the timings
